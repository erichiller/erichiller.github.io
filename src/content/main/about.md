{{< figure src="/img/bio.jpg" title="Eric Hiller" >}}Hello, at this point hopefully you've had a bit to look around, maybe read a few docs or something I've published. Most of the pages on here are the notes and information I've gathered whilst working on whatever project is at hand. Much of this information is years old, but I still go back and reference it often, so I hope that it is useful for others besides myself.

A little about me, I have a lifelong interest in science, technology, and especially human spaceflight, which has been a primary driving force in my life for some time: **to open space up to humankind.**  

I have both a business and technical background, having run a startup ISP and CLEC (Telecommunications provider) and grown it over 10 years before its sale in 2013. Over that period of time I was the wearer of a great many hats, which meant the acquisition of many skills, and this always kept my curiosity fed. Core knowledge in business financials, IP networking, telecommunications systems - from pots , ss7 to sigtran, to sip, mgcp, systems administration, data center / infrastructure engineering, outside plant design and construction, wireless communications from tower construction (tower climbing certified) to microwave link design, and software programming, specifically for operations support systems.

After the sale of my business I spent some time getting to know the world, and traveled and lived in Australia, which I truly love and hope to eventually return to. But work took me back to the United States, and I currently reside in Los Angeles, CA and work as a Infrastructure Engineer on Data Centers.

I am always looking for new opportunities and knowledge growth and greatly appreciate being involved in projects. If you'd like to get in touch, please add me on linked in or github and shoot me a message.

Thanks!

-Eric
